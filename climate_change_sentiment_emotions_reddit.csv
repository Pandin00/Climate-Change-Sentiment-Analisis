link is paywalledstaggering unnerving mindboggling absolutely gobsmackingly bananasas global temperatures shattered records and reached dangerous new highs over and over the past few months my climate scientist colleagues and i have just about run out of adjectives to describe what we have seen data from berkeley earth released on wednesday shows that september was an astounding  degree celsius almost a full degree fahrenheit hotter than the prior record and july and august were around  degree celsius  degree fahrenheit hotter  is almost certain to be the hottest year since reliable global records began in the mids and probably for the past  years and well before thatwhile natural weather patterns including a growing el nio event are playing an important role the record global temperatures we have experienced this year could not have occurred without the approximately  degrees celsius  degrees fahrenheit of warming to date from human sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and while many experts have been cautious about acknowledging it there is increasing evidence that global warming has accelerated over the past  years rather than continued at a gradual steady pace that acceleration means that the effects of climate change we are already seeing  extreme heat waves wildfires rainfall and sea level rise  will only grow more severe in the coming yearsi dont make this claim lightly among my colleagues in climate science there are sharp divisions on this question and some arent convinced its happening climate scientists generally focus on longerterm changes over decades rather than yeartoyear variability and some of my peers in the field have expressed concerns about overinterpreting shortterm events like the extremes weve seen this year in the past i doubted acceleration was happening in part because of a long debate about whether global warming had paused from  to  in hindsight that was clearly not the case im worried that if we dont pay attention today well miss what are increasingly clear signalsi wouldnt be making this argument if i didnt have strong evidence to back it up the data were getting from three sources tells a worrying story about a world warming more quickly than before first the rate of warming weve measured over the worlds land and oceans over the past  years has been  percent higher than the rate since the s with the past nine years being the nine warmest years on record second there has been acceleration over the past few decades in the total heat content of earths oceans where over  percent of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is accumulating third satellite measurements of earths energy imbalance  the difference between energy entering the atmosphere from the sun and the amount of heat leaving  show a strong increase in the amount of heat trapped over the past two decades if earths energy imbalance is increasing over time it should drive an increase in the worlds rate of warmingthere are a number of factors driving the acceleration of warming while the world has made real progress in slowing down the growth of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions they have yet to peak and decline and on top of this we are reaping the results of what the climate scientist james hansen calls our faustian bargain with air pollution for decades air pollution from sulfur dioxide and other hazardous substances in fossil fuels has had a strong temporary cooling effect on our climate but as countries around the world have begun to clean up the air the cooling effect provided by these aerosols has fallen by around  percent since  aerosols have fallen even more in the past three years after a decision to largely phase out sulfur in marine fuels in  these reductions in pollution on top of continued increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations mean that we are encountering some of the unvarnished force of climate change for the first timeuntil recently climate change was framed as an issue that would affect our children today it is nearly omnipresent and it is impossible to ignore and very soon with the acceleration we will experience even more of its effects ice sheets and glaciers will melt faster extreme weather events will become more frequent and even more plants and animals will be put at risk of extinctiondoes this acceleration mean that warming is happening faster than we thought or that it is too late to avoid the worst impacts not necessarily amazingly enough this acceleration quite closely matches what climate models have projected for this period in other words scientists have long foreseen a possible acceleration of warming if our aerosol emissions declined while our greenhouse gas emissions did not thats what were now seeing this may not make you feel much better about the future of warming but should at least make you feel better about our models and the power of science to prepare us for whats to comeits now clear that we can control how warm the planet gets over the coming decades climate models have consistently found that once we get emissions down to net zero the world will largely stop warming there is no warming that is inevitable or in the pipeline after that point of course the world will not cool back down for many centuries unless world powers join in major efforts to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we add but that is the brutal math of climate change and the reason we need to speed up efforts to reduce emissions significantlyon that front there is some reason for cautious hope the world is on the brink of a clean energy transition the international energy agency recently estimated that a whopping  trillion will be invested in clean energy technologies like renewables electric cars and heat pumps in  up from roughly  billion a decade ago prices of solar wind and batteries have plummeted over the past  years and for much of the world solar power is now the cheapest form of electricity if we reduce emissions quickly we can switch from a world in which warming is accelerating to one in which its slowing eventually we can stop it entirelywe are far from on track to meet our climate goals and much more work remains but the positive steps weve made over the past decade should reinforce to us that progress is possible and despair is counterproductive despite the recent acceleration of warming humans remain firmly in the drivers seat and the future of our climate is still up to us to decidedr zeke hausfather berkeley

climatechange,I'm very disturbed by the number of people who support climate engineering,im very disturbed by the number of people who support climate engineering its really not a good idea im going to list a few points that form the basis of my opinion that its really not a good idea carbon dioxide emissions arent just warming the planet they are also making the ocean more acidic oceans uptake co this lowers the ph of the ocean in a process called ocean acidification if we keep emitting co even with a perfect geoengineering scheme that offsets co warming perfectly unlikely the oceans will still become more acidic this is a global threat to ocean life we need to stop emitting co for that reason alone  the earth is warming nonuniformly the arctic is warming x faster than the rest of the planet termed arctic amplification any geoengineering scheme must offset not only the global mean rise in temperature but also the pattern of warming some studies suggest that injecting aerosol in the  stratosphere may not offset arctic amplification this means that even if the global mean temperature is held fixed the arctic temperature may continue to rise this could still lead to sea level rise  unintended consequences as a climate scientist i can tell you this we dont understand everything about climate change not even close and im not trying to make us look bad its just a fact most people outside of academia dont realize an example is climate sensitivity a basic question how much does the temperature rise when doubling co varies by between  and  k in models participating cmip this enormous spread has gotten bigger despite our best efforts to constrain climate models along these lines its worth noting that you can change extremely esoteric parameters in climate model like convective entrainment rate and change the climate sensitivity tremendously and we dont know why now knowing this do you really feel comfortable injecting aerosol into the stratosphere when the only source of knowledge we have on the impacts this would have come from models models that cant agree on climate sensitivity for reasons we dont understand despite decades of research let me be clear we know co is warming the planet and we know why but there are tons of things we dont understand another example is the hydrological cycle we dont have a full grasp of howwhy precipitation will change from raising co there are papers about it constantly so we certainly dont know what would happen to the hydrological cycle if we add aerosol to the stratosphere the fact is this the consequence of injecting aerosol in the stratosphere has a non negligible chance of making things worse i dont have enough trust in climate models to make decisions about geoengineering based on their predictions and this is coming from someone who works at lab developing climate models frankly the studies on climate engineering are not great and still in their infancy many studies on injecting aerosol in the stratosphere model it stupendously crudely they simply reduce the solar constant in a climate model by an amount that they assume aerosols would dim sunlight the reality is injecting aerosol in the stratosphere wouldnt be as simple as reducing the solar constant by a uniform amount globally aerosol can move aersol can interact with longwave radiation as well as shortwave people of course know this but modeling the physics precisely is a challenge that is still being incorporated into studies while im not an expert outside of the science side of things i cant help but think about the international effort required to accomplish climate engineering it would require international cooperation tremendous technological advances and money a question is it really easier to stop climate change by using engineering rather than using more sustainable infrastructure to me both climate engineering and developing sustainable infrastructure face the same difficult hurdles mentioned earlier international cooperation technological advances money so to me its not clear why climate engineering would be an easier way to solve the problem perhaps some people on this thread think its necessary to work on both climate engineering and reducing co another question would the resources spent on climate engineering be better spent on developing sustainable infrastructure i think you know my opinion on thisfinal thoughts  i want to mention something also many people on this thread probably dont realize most climate scientists oppose implementation of climate engineering i work at a lab that employs many climate scientists nobody here thinks its a good idea even people studying climate engineering at my lab dont support its use  this is far from an exhaustive list of drawbacks  i focused on aerosol injection in the stratosphere but other geoengineering schemes such as cloud brightening have been proposed these face similar problems  i support further study of geoengineering a model intercomparison project for it exists and is called geomip note even geomip acknowledges the potential for dangerous consequences associated with geoengineering see edit also wanted to mention that the only intervention i do support direct air capture this is because zero emissions doesnt reverse global warming we need direct air capture to cool the planet see edit  it seems from the comments i have a bit to learn about dac and the different methods of drawing down co im not informed on the drawbacks dac vs other methods in complete honesty i wrote dac but was incorrectly using it to express my opinions about co drawdown in general all i know is this we need negative co emissions to reverse global warming temperatures stabilize with zero emissions maybe dac isnt the best way to accomplish negative emissions but we do need negative emissions to reverse warming,negative,0.5856532454490662,sadness,0.6600257257620493

climatechange,"Phasing out animal agriculture represents “our best and most immediate chance to reverse the trajectory of climate change,",phasing out animal agriculture represents our best and most immediate chance to reverse the trajectory of climate change we wanted to answer a very simple question what would be the impact of a global phaseout of animal agriculture on atmospheric greenhouse gases and their globalheating impact said patrick brown a professor emeritus in the department of biochemistry at stanford university brown coauthored the paper with michael eisen a professor of genetics and development at uc berkeleybased on the model published in the openaccess journal plos climate phasing out animal agriculture over the next  years would have the same effect as a  percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions through the year  this would provide  percent of the net emission reductions necessary to limit global warming to  degrees celsius above preindustrial levels which scientists say is the minimum threshold required to avert disastrous climate changethe changes would stem the authors say from the spontaneous decay of the potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide and the recovery of biomass in natural ecosystems on the more than  percent of humanitys land footprint currently devoted to livestockreducing or eliminating animal agriculture should be at the top of the list of potential climate solutions brown said im hoping that others including entrepreneurs scientists and global policymakers will recognize that this is our best and most immediate chance to reverse the trajectory of climate change and seize the opportunitybrown is also the founder and ceo of impossible foods a company developing alternatives to animals in food production eisen is an advisor to the company both brown and eisen stand to benefit financially from the reduction of animal agricultureunlocking negative emissionsbrown and eisen are not the first to point out that ongoing emissions from animal agriculture are contributing to global warming but what has not been recognized before they say is the much more impactful climate opportunity cost  the potential to unlock negative emissions by eliminating livestockas the methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock diminish atmospheric levels of those potent greenhouse gases will actually drop dramatically within decades brown said and the co that was released into the atmosphere when forests and wild prairies were replaced by feed crops and grazing lands can be converted back into biomass as livestock are phased out and the forests and prairies recoverbrown and eisen used publicly available data on livestock production livestocklinked emissions and biomass recovery potential on land currently used to support livestock to predict how the phaseout of all or parts of global animal agriculture production would alter net anthropogenic or humancaused emissions from  levels they then used a simple climate model to project how these changes would impact the evolution of atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and warming for the rest of the centurythey examined four dietary scenarios an immediate replacement of all animal agriculture with a plantonly diet a more gradual and the authors say more realistic year transition to a global plantonly diet and versions of each where only beef was replaced with plantonly productsfor each hypothetical scenario the scientists assumed that nonagricultural emissions would remain constant and that the land formerly used for livestock production would be converted to grasslands prairies forests and the like that will absorb atmospheric carbon dioxidethe combined effect is both astoundingly large and  equally important  fast with much of the benefit realized by  brown said if animal agriculture were phased out over  years and all other greenhousegas emissions were to continue unabated the phaseout would create a year pause in net greenhouse gas emissions and offset almost  percent of the heating effect of those emissions through the end of the centurywhile the complete phase out of animalbased agriculture was projected to have the largest impact  percent of the emission reductions could be achieved by only replacing ruminants such as cattle and sheep according to the modelwhile their paper does not explore the particulars of what a global phaseout of animal agriculture would entail the authors acknowledge that the economic and social impacts of a global transition to a plantbased diet would be acute in many regions and locales and that it is likely that substantial global investment will be required to ensure that people who currently making a living from animal agriculture do not suffer when it is reduced or replacedbut they write in both cases these investments must be compared to the economic and humanitarian disruptions of significant global warmingchanging attitudesmany will scoff at the idea that billions of people can be convinced to switch to a plantonly diet within  years to these skeptics eisen points out that other revolutions have happened in less time we went from having no cellphones to cellphones being ubiquitous in less time than that electricity cars solar panels  all became common in a relatively short period of time eisen saidmoreover brown added societal attitudes toward food are far from fixed five hundred years ago nobody in italy had ever seen a tomato sixty years ago nobody in china had ever drunk a coke mutton was once the most popular meat in america he said people around the world readily adopt new foods especially if they are delicious nutritious convenient and affordablethe scientists have made all of the raw data they used as well as their calculations and the computer code used to carry out the calculations publicly available so that others can make up their own mindthe great thing about science is that in the end it all comes down to whether the conclusions are supported by the evidence brown said and in this case they are,neutral,0.6126807729403178,joy,0.6527118980884552

away from them we get floods on top of fires sooty water running away from a blaze that wont stop blazingthese thunderstorms are unlike any i have ever seen before people say thunderstorms bring a false twilight this is a very late twilight  nautical twilight perhaps early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting and its a while yet before the rain falls though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ashridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones you just hope one of these lightning strikes doesnt happen nearbybecause these thunderstorms start new fires they put nothing out while at the same time bring more fire more destructionive sat on tenterhooks waiting to hear

climatechange,"We are telling ourselves pretty stories, and it's not helpful",we are telling ourselves pretty stories and its not helpful  there are a few common stories i see popping up on here and the internet often renewables are now much cheaper than fossil sources we will be net zero by given time frame and get rid of fossil fuels soonthe unspoken one is that there is nothing else to be done about climate change other than cleaning up the energy systemthis is not a pronuclear piece or antirenewables im writing this because i think these slightly rosecolored views we give ourselves are harmful there are many pieces in this puzzle and by not acknowledging blindspots we will overdo some things underdo others miss doing certain things entirely and ultimately get this wrongfossil fuels are an incredibly tough boss match neither renewables nor nuclear can stand up to it at present time when we first rip something we need out of the earth they tend to be bound up in dioxide form for example silicon dioxide in order to get pure silicon out we have to break the silicon dioxide bond with a lot of thermal energy and need a reductant that it reacts with carbon basically coal is thrown in a  degree celsius furnace with the silicon dioxide to get a pure material out feeding in thermal energy is how a lot of stuff is born and thats often also true even when it comes from recylced sourcesthis heat energy approaches ckwh looking at coal its energy density and its commodity price assuming close to  efficiency of burning it the thermal and reductant manufacturing inputs are dirt cheap this is the birth cradle of our renewables meant to save us this is what we ultimately have to compete withnow if you have a solar system in germany that produces electricity at say  cents per kwh and you feed it back into its own input a hypothetical electric tungsten resistance furnance heater with some captured carbon source or green hydrogen those new panels are now no longer the price of the first set made by coal not even close the silicon ingots already go for barely more than these incredibly cheap energy inputs that were fed in even in saudi arabia with ckwh solar but only  capacity factor we are not even close nuclear in its current form is also not there renewables are only cheap because of the wonder of fossil fuels that were fed in in the first placethis means that things do not just get more expensive once you shut off the fossil sources at the origin it all collapses civilizational output drops dramatically there is less excess energy to do all the things that we currently do such as for example maintain medical and scientific institutions that allow us to adapt in the face of adversity say inventing the next set of antibiotics when we desperately need will need themthis will not be easy nor will it be fast acknowledging that i think will allow us to make better decisions there will be a lot of temperature increase maybe if we acknowledge that we can work on making natural ecosystems and its inhabitants more resilient to it maybe we could stop growing homogenous factory farm trees for biomass generation that is then lumped in with wind and solar statistics instead create more mixed tree forests to have higher population and diversity of species that are then more likely to be able to adapt to the climate changei dont have the answers i am just trying to say there may be some creative things we are missing because we are so narrowed in on this rosecolored story and this single set solution maybe we can make the ocean more resilient to climate change by exploding its fish and whale population through fertiziling it and in the process removing  billion tons of co annually these things are not getting a lot of attention we have foregone old environtalism which seemed more rich in its concerns for narrow climate change focus specifically the energy system instead we are engaged in flamewars especially between the pronuclear and prorenewables camps which is incredibly counter productive because neither side wants to now look at the limitations of each energy system and so we cant use them effectively we cant say for example well why are we putting up panels in canada because that would be acknowledging that they are not the perfect energy solution in every single regard engineers design based on tradeoffs which means being aware of both strengths and limitations so that you can efficiently place all the pieces in the right placesi think we have to pull on every single lever to get through this some clever environmental hacks like described above continued use of renewables but in a targeted and cost effective manner yes also immense focus on nuclear energy efficiency measures such as heat pumps insulation etc the solution has to be diverse to be robust i do think because the energy density of uranium is so unbelievably high we may be able to go much further there but i do not want to go into it here because i dont want to be dismissed as some pronuclear shill as far as i go am pronuclear  prore maybe we should all bei have an electrical engineering background but have not worked in the energy industry my engineering and physics background is a helpful lense but im learning from the outside as you all are as well i am open to being wrong but please be kind to my ego as we all should be if i come across as arrogant i apologize deep down im aware that im not smart im an overevolved ape who can only hold  things at a time in his working memory and who has to come together with other overevolved apes in order to figure out how to go up against the black gold that planet earth baked with hundreds of millions of years worth of solar energy i think the best thing we can do to get
